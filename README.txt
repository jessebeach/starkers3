Starkers3

================
Based on Starkers by Elliot Jay Stocks (http://elliotjaystocks.com/starkers). Adds WordPress 3.0 menus for the header and footer, a very
simple scaffolding CSS file, and basic <div> wrappers for the #header, #footer, #sidebar, and #main.

This project is intended as a temporary fix until Starkers is updated with WordPress 3.0 features.
